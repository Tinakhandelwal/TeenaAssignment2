# TeenaAssignment2

This is a online registration form in which user can enter their details. I made this using HTML and CSS.I learned many new things during this assignment like placeholder, dropdownlist, select option, various input types.
I basically learned difference between div & span in this assignment. I used table for making this form. There is some css concept like box-shadow.
This assignment is really helpful for a begineer to enhance html and css skills.
